3. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, carefully place the pakoburger patties in the pan and fry until golden brown on both sides.
4. While the pakoburgers are frying, prepare the chapati dough by mixing chapati flour with water to form a soft dough. Roll out thin circles from this dough.
