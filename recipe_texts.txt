Dish Name: African-Polish Pierogi Stew
Cuisines: Polish + African

Ingredients:
- 1 lb. pierogi dough (traditional Polish)
- 2 lbs. assorted fillings (e.g., potato, sauerkraut, and mushroom for traditional pierogi; add smoked kielbasa for fusion)
- 2 lbs. various African stew ingredients (e.g., okra, plantains, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, coconut milk, palm oil, spices like cayenne pepper, paprika, and curry powder)
- 1 can (14 oz.) chickpeas
- 2 lbs. beef or chicken (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Prepare the pierogi dough according to the instructions provided on a traditional Polish pierogi recipe. Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling it out and filling with the assorted pierogi fillings (traditional and fusion). Boil or steam the pierogi until they are cooked through, then set aside.

2. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat up palm oil over medium-high heat. Add chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and African spices like cayenne pepper, paprika, and curry powder, sautéing for 3-5 minutes until fragrant.

3. If using meat, add it to the pot with the aromatics and cook until browned.

4. Add tomatoes, bell peppers, okra, and plantains (if using) to the pot, stirring well to combine with the other ingredients. Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.

5. Pour coconut milk into the pot and bring everything to a simmer. Add chickpeas, pierogi, and salt and pepper to taste. Let the stew cook for another 10-15 minutes so that all the flavors meld together.

6. Serve the African-Polish Pierogi Stew hot, garnished with fresh cilantro or parsley (traditional Polish parsley would work well for this fusion dish). Enjoy!
